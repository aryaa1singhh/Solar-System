# Solar-System

**Overview**
This project is an object-oriented simulation of solar systems written in Java. It models a star and the planets that orbit it, including their physical characteristics and derived properties.

**A solar system has:**

- A name

- A luminosity (the brightness of the star relative to the Sun)

**Each planet has:**

- A name

- A mass (in Earth masses)

- A radius (in Earth radii)

- A distance from its star (in astronomical units, AU)

- An orbital period (calculated from its distance)

- A surface gravity (calculated from mass and radius)

- A habitability status (calculated based on the star’s luminosity, and the planet’s mass and distance)

**Features**

Create solar systems with stars and planets.

- Add planets with physical properties.

- Automatically calculate:

- Orbital period from distance.

- Surface gravity from mass and radius.

- Habitability from star luminosity and planet parameters.

- Compare planets and retrieve them by name.

- Output the system and its planets in a human-readable format.
